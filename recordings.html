      At Truman State University, I get many opportunities to perform within our various ensembles. 
      So far, I have participated in the Truman Statesmen Marching Band, Truman's Jazz Ensemble, both of Truman's Wind Symphonies, 
      and the Saxophone Studio from which I've gotten these recordings from. 
      Below is a few of the many performances I've had here at Truman:

        <h4>Sonata for Saxohpone by Bernhard Heiden:</h4>
        <p>Bernhard Heiden's Sonata for Alto Saxophone and Piano was his very first published work. 
        It is now one of the most performed pieces of saxophone repertoire ever; it was the first sonata 
        to become a standard part of collegiate alto saxophone repertoire and is considered a cornerstone 
        for classical saxophone performance. This work is very instrumentally conceived, and not at all in 
        vocal style. The sonata has three movements: Allegro in G major, Vivace in C minor, and Adagio-Presto 
        in G major. The sonata is polyphonic; while it is written for solo saxophone, both piano part and 
        saxophone part have independent melodic lines throughout the piece.

        class="intextLink" target="_blank">Tyler Cosley</a><br>
        <br> Due to time constraints for the concert this was recorded from, I only performed the first two movements. 
        There were many things that I learned from the experience of practicing and performing this piece.
        I hope that, even with the mixing, that you can enjoy this piece as much as I liked learning it!</p>

        <h4>Sonata for Baritone Saxophone and Piano by Sherwood Shaffer</h4>
        <p><i>Sonata for Baritone Saxophone and Piano</i> was composed in the late fall of persents a bold main theme that is later
          contrasted by a "music box" more lyrical theme with a fugal last part before both themes return in a quasi-sonata form;
          the slow movement is a three-part song form with a cadenza for the saxophone that explores some of the altissimo register
          of the instrument before the concluding phrase of the first theme; the rondo finale alternates two quick-driving themes
          with a quieter, more lyrical theme plus a short cadenza with [the] altissimo register before flying downward into
          the lowest register for the end.
        <br>- Program notes by composer, additions added by Shayden Hawkins<br>
        <br>For this concert, because of multiple time constraints I only learned the first movement of this piece
        I would personally say this was not my best playing but I'm grateful to Dr. Gao to giving me the opportunity to perform this lovely piece
        and I hope that it is still enjoyable piece to listen to me perform.</p>
