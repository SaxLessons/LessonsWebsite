    <div class="bioText">
      <p>I am an alumni of Chillicothe High School (CHS) in Chillicothe, Missouri, 
      in which I was a part of their band program for 7 years. 
      <br>While at CHS, I had achieved many things such as:</p>
          <ul class="bioText">
            <li>Making the All State Jazz Band as an alternate</li>
            <li>Receiving both a Gold and Silver award at the All-State Solo and Small Ensemble Festival</li>
            <li>Being the only student at CHS to go to the <a href="https://www.bandworld.org/WIBC/" target="_blank" class="intextLink">Western International Band Clinic</a> in Seattle, Washington</li>
          </ul>
      <p>I am currently a student at Truman State University pursing a Bachelors of Arts in Music Education, 
      officially called a Bachelors of Arts in Music (Pre-Certification), with the goal of receiving my Masters in Arts in Education (MAE) from Truman; 
      I am also pursing a minor in Jazz Studies. 
      During my time here I have participated in many of the ensembles, including:
        <ul>
          <li>Truman's top Jazz Ensemble as the Baritone Saxophone player for two years</li>
          <li>the two Wind Symphonies for two year on Baritone Saxophone</li>
          <li>the Truman Statesmen marching band on Alto Saxophone and Mellophone</li>
          <li>Various other smaller ensembles like sax quartets</li>
        </ul>
      I have also been taking saxophone lessons with the incredible <a href="http://www.xingaosax.com/index.html" target="_blank" class="intextLink">
      Xin Gao</a> throughout me time here on top of many other clubs and activities.
      I am dedicated to teaching the new generation the value of music and self expression within that medium just as my band directors 
      and private instructors have been able to do with me over the years.</p>
