            <p>I believe I take a more relaxed approach than most other people in my approach to teaching. 
            While the relationship between myself and a student is, formally, a student-teacher relationship, 
            we both have ways to go in learning and mastering the saxophone. 
            Just as my saxophone teachers have been able to help me by revealing the little mistakes I make that 
            can make the biggest impacts in my performance, I want to give the mistakes that I can notice being 
            made by a student while teaching them that can have the greatest impact of their performance. 
            I currently only teach students at the upper middle school and high school levels, 
            though arrangements can be made for students outside of that range. 
            I also only currently teach in-person lessons, as I do not believe myself capable of teaching in 
            a virtual setting at this moment.</p>
          </div>

          <!-- payment info for lessons -->
          <div class="cardSegment">
            <div class="reducedCard"> <h4>Lesson Rates</h4> </div>
            <p>The lesson rate will be $10 per 30 minutes of lessons, or $20 per hour. 
            I am currently not offering lessons that are outside of those timeframes. 
            Payment will be accepted on the day of the lessons if it is physical cash or within 1 day of the 
            lesson day and time if paid digitally. Digital payment methods can be discussed between me and the 
            student/parent(s) as required.</p>

            <h1>Lesson Policy</h1>

        <div class="flexbox" style="flex-wrap: wrap;">
          <!-- Late policies -->
          <div class="cardSegment">
            <div class="reducedCard"> <h4>Late Policy</h4> </div>
            <p>If a student is late, I expect the student to still show up and be at their lesson for however long 
            they can be if the student can arrive within their normal lesson time. While exceptions can be made 
            on a case-by-case basis, I generally expect payment in full in the instance of a late lesson. 
            If a lesson cannot be held and adequate time (roughly 24 hours before the day and time of the lesson) is given,
            the lesson will generally be cancelled and no payments will be required for that week. If the student/parent(s) are 
            paying in cash, I expect the total payment for the previous lesson and current lesson at the start of the next lesson. 
            The timeframe for online payment is not affected by the student being late for or missing a lesson.</p>

          <div class="cardSegment">
            <div class="reducedCard"> <h4>Makeup Policy</h4> </div>
            <p>In order for the student to make up a lesson, the student or their guardian(s) must contact me 
            (<a class="intextLink" href="contact.html">see on "Contacts" page</a>) within 24 hours before the normally scheduled 
            lesson time. If I, for whatever reason, need to reschedule a lesson, I will be in contact as soon as 
            possible to reschedule; I will likely contact via email or by cell phone if this is the case. 
            The same payment and lesson procedures for normal lessons will be followed in the case of a make up 
            lesson, with the payment shifted to match the new lesson day and time.</p>

          <!-- Lesson Materials -->
          <div class="cardSegment">
            <div class="reducedCard"> <h4>Lesson Materials</h4> </div>
            <p>The lessons material will vary on the needs of the student and the goals set for them, 
            but do not expect a requirement of buying materials for lessons unless the goals of the student 
            would require it. If external materials are required, I will first try what material(s) are needed 
            and the best place to order it. If the cost of extra materials is something the student/gaurdians 
            cannot hold themselves, arrangements can be made to offset the costs on the student(s)/guardian(s)</p>
